In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with dynamic imports within a deeply nested component structure.  The error manifests as a runtime exception, often a `ReferenceError` indicating that a module is not defined, despite the import appearing correct. This occurs inconsistently and is exacerbated by hot module replacement (HMR). The issue seems linked to the server component's asynchronous nature and how Next.js resolves imports during the rendering process in a hierarchical component structure.
